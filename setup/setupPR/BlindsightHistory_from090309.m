% notes to self regarding later training steps:
% 299 completed all of the earlier protocol; needs object, psychophysics of
% motion and orientation tasks
% 297 still needs to do "hard motion" step 8 of previous protocol
% 298 still needs more time on "hard motion" step 8 of previous protocol
% 302 still needs more time on "hard motion" step 8 of previous protocol
% 307 needs to start motion on easiest level (step 6 of prvious protocol)
% 309 needs to start motion on easiest level (step 6 of prvious protocol)
